# Paul-the-turtle
Paul the turtle is work in progress!

# Idea
This is a playful way to learn C# by telling a turtle how to move. The turtles move set is very limited but with the help of a smart programmer it can achive quite alot. 

## How to play
Right now the player part is under development. Please come back later to see how you can use this programm to learn the basics of C#.



# Coding Style
I feel like I have to explain a little bit of the coding style in this project. While none of this effects the user learning C#, I tried to learn quit a bit by doing this programm as well. To do this I try to follow some rules from the Book CleanCode, and also try to follow (when useful) the GOF principles. 
One of the strangest parts in this code is probably the missing i infront of an interface. This is because no one needs to know that a function is returning an interface. It is an object and shall be used like it is on (technicly it is one and you only see what the interfaces tells you...). A better explanaition can be found in the book Clean Code.
